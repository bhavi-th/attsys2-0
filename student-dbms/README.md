# Student DBMS

Made to automate the database creation process.

`main.py` holds the code that takes in student data in pdf format and creates + updates the database.

## Usage

Pass in the path to pdf and path to output file as arguments.

`python3 main.py <source.pdf> <output.db>`

Make sure all the required libraries are installed. Do not upload the pdf or databases to the repository.
Keep the pdf in a different path and set the output databse path to student-databases.
